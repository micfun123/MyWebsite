        <h3> 
            I am a student, developer, YouTuber and a lover of marvel. 
            I have been making stuff since I was 12 but got serious about programming due to lockdown. 
            I am from the UK however have lived across the world. The language to code in is python, and my prefered speaking language is English. 
            I try to do something programming each week, even if it's just one short daily challenge. I have been working on multiple projects such as discord bots, APIS and a few websites.
